      "description": "This spicy Belgian ale spends several months cold conditioning to let the flavors meld, but it's worth waiting for. Star anise, orange peel, and coriander are used to add layers of flavor and aroma to this beer. Speaking of extra time, this beer spends 50% longer in the brew kettle to bring out more caramel notes and enhance this beer's natural color."
