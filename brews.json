Speaking of extra time, this beer spends 50% longer in the brew kettle to bring out more caramel notes and enhance this beer's natural color."

Typical oak and vanilla notes blend smoothly into our robust malt profile, finishing with what seems to be a hint of coconut. The magical esters strike again!"

The cranberries, malts, and even the hops were chosen to blend perfectly into a well rounded Imperial Stout that would hold up to the barrel character as it aged. Waiting patiently (not our strong suit), we emptied the barrel just as it reached perfection."
