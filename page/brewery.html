        <h3>Crafting through Art & Science</h3>

        <div>
            <p>
                Starting off in an attached garage in Beaverton, Cooper Mountain Ale Works motto was always "Discover the beer you didn't know you loved".
            </p>
            <p>
                What brought together the team that founded the brewery was a desire to make the beers we couldn't find locally. In the history of brewing, there
                have been thousands of styles created by people for centuries, and yet what you find a a lot of taprooms is variations on a small number of styles.
                We love what the Northwest has done to beer culture, and as we joined that community we found ourselves pulled to making things that we had a hard time
                finding for ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today we brew a wide range of beer on a 10 barrel production system in downtown Tigard. We also maintain a smaller 3 barrel system, still in the garage we got our
                start in, for pilot batches and smaller runs of specialty beers.
            </p>

        <p>Hold your next party, family dinner, or corporate offsite where you can get some great food and great drink! Our gathering space is used by local non-profits,
            community organizers, and friends just looking for a place to celebrate eachother.</p>
